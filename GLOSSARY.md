## 📊 Technical Analysis Terms

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
**What it is:** A technical indicator that measures whether a stock is overbought (too expensive) or oversold (too cheap).  
**How it works:** RSI ranges from 0 to 100. Values above 70 typically indicate overbought conditions, while values below 30 indicate oversold conditions.  
**Why it matters:** Helps traders identify potential entry and exit points.

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
**What it is:** A trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a stock's price.  
**How it works:** When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it's typically a bullish (buy) signal. When it crosses below, it's bearish (sell).  
**Why it matters:** Helps identify trend changes and momentum shifts.

### Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)
**What it is:** A calculation that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price.  
**SMA (Simple Moving Average):** Average of prices over a set period (e.g., 50-day average).  
**EMA (Exponential Moving Average):** Gives more weight to recent prices.  
**Why it matters:** Helps identify trends and support/resistance levels.

### Bollinger Bands
**What it is:** A volatility indicator that consists of a middle band (moving average) and two outer bands.

**Why it matters:** Helps identify volatility and potential price reversals.

### Support and Resistance Levels

## 📈 Portfolio & Risk Terms

### Beta
**What it is:** A measure of a stock's volatility compared to the overall market.

**Why it matters:** Helps assess portfolio risk and diversification.

### Volatility
**What it is:** A measure of how much a stock's price fluctuates.
