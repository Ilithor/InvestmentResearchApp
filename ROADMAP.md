### What This App Does NOT Do

- **Browser Compatibility**: Works best in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Some features may not work in older browsers.

## ⭐ Standout Features (Coming Soon)

Beyond the standard features, we're building unique capabilities that set this app apart:

### 🎯 Advanced Risk Management
**What it does:** Comprehensive risk analysis beyond basic metrics

**You get:**
- **Stress testing** - See how your portfolio would have performed during historical crashes (2008 financial crisis, COVID-19 crash, etc.)
- **"What if" scenarios** - Model different market conditions (e.g., "What if tech stocks drop 30%?")
- **Correlation heatmaps** - Visualize which stocks move together (helps identify over-concentration)
- **Value at Risk (VaR)** - Calculate potential losses at different confidence levels (e.g., "95% chance of losing no more than $X")
- **Tail risk analysis** - Identify exposure to extreme market events

**Example Use Case:**
You have a portfolio of tech stocks. The stress test shows that if tech crashes like it did in 2000, you'd lose 40% of your portfolio value. This helps you decide if you need more diversification.

**Why it matters:** Most apps don't offer this level of risk analysis. Understanding your portfolio's risk is crucial for long-term success.

---

### 🧪 Strategy Builder & Backtesting
**What it does:** Create and test investment strategies before risking real money

**You get:**
- **Visual strategy builder** - Drag-and-drop interface to create trading rules (e.g., "Buy when RSI < 30 AND volume > average")
- **Historical backtesting** - Test your strategy against real historical market data to see how it would have performed
- **Paper trading mode** - Practice your strategy with virtual money in real-time (no real money at risk)
- **Performance metrics** - See Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted return), max drawdown (worst loss), win rate, and more
- **Strategy comparison** - Test multiple strategies side-by-side to see which performs best

**Example Use Case:**
You create a strategy: "Buy when a stock's 50-day moving average crosses above its 200-day average." You backtest it on the last 5 years of data and find it would have returned 15% annually. You then paper trade it for a month before risking real money.

**Why it matters:** Test your ideas safely. Very few free apps offer robust backtesting capabilities.

---

### 🔔 Smart Alerts & Notifications
**What it does:** Intelligent, context-aware alerts that reduce noise

**You get:**
- **Pattern recognition alerts** - Get notified when technical patterns form (e.g., "AAPL: RSI dropped below 30 with 2x average volume - potential oversold condition")
- **Earnings calendar reminders** - Alerts before companies in your portfolio report earnings
- **News impact alerts** - Notifications when significant news affects stocks you own or watch
- **Portfolio rebalancing suggestions** - Alerts when your portfolio allocation drifts from your target (e.g., "Tech allocation is now 45%, target is 30%")
- **Custom alert logic** - Build your own alert conditions (e.g., "Alert me if any stock in my portfolio drops more than 5% in a day")

**Example Use Case:**
You set an alert: "Notify me if Apple stock drops below $150." When it happens, you get a notification (email or browser notification) so you can decide whether to buy.

**How it works:** Alerts are checked periodically (not instant). Free data sources may have delays. For real-time alerts, you'd need a paid data subscription.

**Why it matters:** Stay informed without being overwhelmed. Get alerts that actually matter to your investments.

---

### 📝 Investment Journal
**What it does:** Learn from your investment decisions

**You get:**
- **Trade journal** - Record why you bought or sold each stock (e.g., "Bought AAPL because of strong iPhone sales and new product launches")
- **Decision tracking** - Tag trades with reasons (e.g., "technical analysis", "dividend play", "value opportunity")
- **Performance attribution** - See which types of decisions led to gains vs. losses (e.g., "My value picks returned 20%, but my momentum trades lost 5%")
- **Reflection prompts** - Periodic questions to review decisions (e.g., "Did your original investment thesis play out?")
- **Pattern identification** - Discover biases in your trading (e.g., "I tend to sell winners too early and hold losers too long")

**Example Use Case:**
You buy a stock because you think it's undervalued. You record this in your journal. Six months later, the stock drops 20%. You review your journal entry and realize you didn't consider the company's high debt. This helps you avoid similar mistakes.

**Why it matters:** Most investors don't learn from mistakes. This helps you improve over time.

---

### 📊 Advanced Visualizations
**What it does:** Next-level data visualization for deeper insights

**You get:**
- Customizable dashboards (drag-and-drop widgets)
- Correlation heatmaps
- Performance attribution charts
- Sector performance heat maps
- Interactive portfolio visualizations

**Why it matters:** Visual data is easier to understand. See patterns you might miss in tables.

---

### 📰 Alternative Data Integration
**What it does:** Incorporate non-traditional data sources for unique insights

**You get:**
- News sentiment scoring
- Insider trading activity alerts

- Market sentiment indicators
